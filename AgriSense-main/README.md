PROJECT: AgriSense
=====================

AgriSense aims to revolutionize farming practices by providing personalized crop recommendations based on soil type, temperature, and soil nutrient levels, specifically phosphorus and nitrogen.<br>
By leveraging data science and machine learning techniques, this system assists farmers and agricultural professionals in making informed decisions, ultimately enhancing crop productivity and sustainability.<br><br>

The project addresses the current challenges faced by farmers, including limited access to expert advice, soil nutrient imbalances, and climate variability. Through the development of a user-friendly
web application, farmers can input their soil and environmental parameters to receive tailored crop suggestions in real-time.<br><br>
Firstly, Farmers need to get their land's soil lab tested to get the soil's nutrient values based on which the web application will tell the farmer what crop to grow on their land.<br><br>

How to use
---------
1. Get the soil nutrients level from the lab.
2. Gather intel on the locality temperature,rainfall and humidity.
3. Install modules necessary for running the application given in modules_used.txt file using pip.
4. On the device where you want to run the application, get the IP address of the network on which the device is connected.
5. Paste the IP address as the host in app.py file(last line) and change the port to the available one on your device.
